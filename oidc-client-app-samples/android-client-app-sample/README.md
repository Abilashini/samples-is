# wso2-is-android-sample
Sample application to demonstrate the integration of WSO2 IS with Android Applications.
The application uses the [AppAuth for Android library](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android), which is a native app SDK for [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) and 
[Open ID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/) implementing modern best practices.
